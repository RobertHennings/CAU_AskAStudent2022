# CAU_AskAStudent2022
This repository holds material that was handed out to A-level students who took part in the CAU project "Ask A Student" where the participants experience a whole day as a normal student at university in the subject economics/business administration together with their mentors. I worked as a mentor during the winter semester 2021/2022 and the summer term 2023. Part ot the day was also a little case study that the students should solve in groups. In the case study the students should solve a typical market equilibrium problem in a stock market setting. The analytical solution in Python Code can be found here, so that everyone interested in it can be provided with the detailed solution.
This material and the analytical solution for it can be found in here. In this project I worked as mentor an created all the material that can be found here and was handed out.
